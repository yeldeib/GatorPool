To get started, you'll need to install node.js and npm. Then you'll need to install react and react-dom using npm. For example, to install react: npm i install react. I'm pretty sure you have to do that inside the directory you clone because npm packages aren't typically installed globally.

I'll be using VS Code to edit which I think is pretty solid, but you can use whatever you're comfortable with.

To start the app all you have to do is: npm start. 

Everyone should make their own branch to work on. DON'T WORK ON MASTER! When you want to merge your changes make a pull request so a team member can review the changes and approve it then your branch will be merged with master.
